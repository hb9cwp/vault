# `sepiortsm` Seal

The Sepior seal configures Vault to use a TSM cluster with Multi-Party
Computation (MPC) nodes as the seal wrapping mechanism. 
The Sepior seal is activated by one of the following:

- The presence of a `seal "sepiortsm"` block in Vault's configuration file.

- The presence of the environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE` set to `sepiortsm`.
  If enabling via environment variable, all other required values specific to
  Sepior (i.e. `SEPIOR_USER_ID`, etc.) must be also supplied, as
  well as all other Sepior-related environment variables that lends to successful
  authentication (i.e. `SEPIOR_PASSWORDS`, etc.).

## `sepiortsm` Example

This example shows configuring Sepior seal through the Vault
configuration file by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "sepiortsmwrapper" {
 userID = ""
 passwords = ""
 urls = ""
}
```
XXX ToDo, for info only: 
```
const credentials string = `{
        "userID": "owxxxHT",
        "urls": [ "https://pxxx1.tsm.sepior.net", "https://pxxx2.tsm.sepior.net", "https://px3.tsm.sepior.net" ],
        "passwords": [ "tfxxxMq", "vcxxxjW", "Dwxxx18" ]
```

## `sepiortsm` Parameters

These parameters apply to the `seal` stanza in the Vault configuration file:

- `userID` `(string: <required>)`: The user ID for credentials to query the Sepior TSM SDK.
  May also be specified by the `SEPIOR_USER_ID` environment variable.

- `passwords` `(string: <required>)`: The passwords, one per MPC cluster node.
  May also be specified by the `SEPIOR_PASSWORDS` environment variable. 

- `urls` `(string: <required>)`: The URLs of the MPC cluster nodes. 
  May also be specified by the `SEPIOR_URLS` environment variable.

## Authentication

Authentication-related values must be provided, either as environment
variables or as configuration parameters.

- `SEPIOR_USER_ID`

- `SEPIOR_PASSWORDS`
